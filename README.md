This library is under development,  and,  like the [secp256k1-zkp](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp) C library it depends on,  this is a research effort to determine an optimal API for end-users of the liquidjs ecosystem.

## Development

### Build steps (with Docker)

```sh
$ npm install
$ git submodule update --init
$ docker build -t secp256k1-js .
$ npm run configure
$ npm run make
$ npm run test
```

### Build steps (without Docker)

#### blindGeneratorBlindSum(values, nInputs, blindGenerators, blindFactors)

```haskell
blindGeneratorBlindSum :: Array -> Number -> Array -> Array -> Buffer
```

Set the final Pedersen blinding factor correctly when the generators themselves have blinding factors.

* `values` array of string asset values.
* `nInputs` How many of the initial array elements represent commitments that will be negated in the final sum.
* `blindGenerators` array of asset blinding factors.
* `blindFactors` array of commitment blinding factors.

#### blindSum(blinds[, nneg=0])

```haskell
blindSum :: Array [-> Number] -> Buffer
```

Compute the sum of multiple positive and negative blinding factors.

* `blinds` array of 32-byte blinding factors.

### Rangeproof

#### sign(commit, blind, nonce, value[, minValue="0", base10Exp=0, minBits=0, message=[], extraCommit=[]])

```haskell
sign :: Buffer -> Buffer -> Buffer -> String [-> String -> Number -> Number -> Buffer -> Buffer] -> Buffer
```

Author a proof that a committed value is within a range.

* `commit` 33-byte commitment to being proved.
* `blind` 32-byte blinding factor used by commit.
* `nonce` 32-byte secret nonce used to initialize the proof.
* `value` actual value of the commitment as string.
* `minValue` constructs a proof where the verifer can tell the minimum value is at least the specified amount (passed as string).
* `base10Exp` base-10 exponent. Digits below above will be made public, but the proof will be made smaller. Allowed range is -1 to 18.
* `minBits` number of bits of the value to keep private. (0 = auto/minimal, - 64).
* `message` data to be embedded in the rangeproof that can be recovered by rewinding the proof.
* `extraCommit` additional data to be covered in rangeproof signature.

#### info(proof)

```haskell
info :: Object -> Object
```

Extract some basic information from a range-proof.

* `proof` rangeproof to extract information to.

#### verify(commit, proof[, extraCommit=[]])

```haskell
verify :: Buffer -> Object [-> Buffer] -> Bool
```

Verify a proof that a committed value is within a range.

* `commit` 33-byte commitments being proved.
* `proof` rangeproof used to verify commitment.
* `extraCommit` additional data covered in rangeproof signature.

#### rewind(commit, proof, nonce[, extraCommit = []])

```haskell
rewind :: Buffer -> Object -> Buffer [-> Buffer] -> Object

* `commit` 33-byte commitment being proved.
* `proof` rangeproof.
* `nonce` 32-byte secret nonce used by the prover.
* `extraCommit` additional data covered in rangeproof signature.

Returns wether the value is within the range [0..2^64), the specifically proven range is in the min/max value outputs, and the value and blinding were recovered.

* `value` uint64 which has the exact value of the commitment.
* `minValue` uint64 which will be updated with the minimum value that commit could have.
* `maxValue` uint64 which will be updated with the maximum value that commit could have.
